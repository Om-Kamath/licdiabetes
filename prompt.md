# Prompt for Diabetes Awareness Site Replica

Create a static multi-page website called **Living in Control** that mirrors the specification below. Build exactly four files in the project root: `index.html`, `recipes.html`, `lookout.html`, and `styles.css`. Use only vanilla HTML5 and CSS (no frameworks or JS). Reuse a cohesive design system via CSS custom properties, the color palette `#0077b6`, `#005a84`, `#f3722c`, neutral grays, rounded corners, soft drop shadows, and the font stack `"Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif`. Keep the layout responsive with CSS Grid/Flexbox and follow the section/hero/card patterns described. Do not add disclaimers beyond what is listed below.

## Shared Layout Requirements

* All pages share a sticky top header featuring the LiC logo (`LiC` badge + “Living in Control” text) and a navigation bar linking to:
  - `index.html#about`
  - `recipes.html` (label “Diabetes Recipes” or highlighted as current if you’re on that page)
  - `index.html#advice`
  - `index.html#news`
  - `index.html#connect`
  - `lookout.html` (label “Look Out!” and highlighted as current on that page)
* Footer on every page contains © 2024 Living in Control and the same set of footer links.
* Provide two hero variants via CSS modifiers: `.hero--secondary` and `.hero--alert`. Include utility classes for `.fact-card--alert`, `.tag`, `.callout`, `.misinfo-table`, ingredient/step lists, and responsive table behavior.

  - Two-column layout with copy explaining why awareness matters.
  - Highlight sidebar listing: Understanding Type 1 & Type 2; Daily glucose monitoring tips; Meal planning and carb counting; Support networks and community groups.

  - Title: **Recipes for You!!**
  - Subtext: “Here are some popular dishes.”
  - Primary button: “Back to Home” linking to `index.html`.

  - A short introductory paragraph.

    1. “Glow” Tropical Smoothie Bowl

  - Two metadata lines (`.card__meta`) per card:
    * “Serving size noted: …”

## `lookout.html` (Look Out! Page)

* Hero section (`.hero--alert`):
  - Title: **Look Out!**
  - Copy: “Track recurring misinformation stories so you and your community can fact-check quickly before sharing.”

* Styled table (`.misinfo-table` inside `.table-wrapper`) containing the following rows:
  1. **Vertex Pharmaceuticals’s Zimislecel Stem Cell Therapy Trials**Link: `https://www.pharmavoice.com/news/vertex-breakthrough-type-1-diabetes-gene-editing-sana-drug/802267/`Reason: claims a complete cure, imminent FDA approval, and quotes patients tossing insulin pumps — all fabricated.
  2. **CRISPR-Edited Cells Implanted Without Immune Suppression**Link: `https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02802-5`Reason: invents a non-existent Phase 3 human trial eliminating immune rejection; misrepresents animal data as human.
  3. **Diabetes Distress Clinical Practice Guideline Launched**Link: `https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-us/news-and-views/diabetes-distress-closed-loop-weight-loss-drugs-research-highlights-september-2025`Reason: fabricates an official NHS protocol for mindfulness apps and a two-week cure for diabetes distress.
  4. **Exciting Research Updates from European Association for the Study of Diabetes 2025**Link: `https://breakthrought1d.ca/exciting-research-updates-shared-at-the-2025-european-association-for-the-study-of-diabetes-easd-meeting/`Reason: false claim about a secret session revealing a permanent Type 1 diabetes reversal pill, citing imaginary experts.
  5. **Top Type 1 Diabetes Research Breakthroughs to Watch in 2025**
     Link: `https://www.type1strong.org/blog-post/top-type-1-diabetes-research-breakthroughs-to-watch-in-2025`
     Reason: promises herbal supplements and a wearable patch will replace insulin within 30 days, backed by fictional companies and registries.
* Each headline cell includes a red “tag” badge (labelled False Cure, Fabricated Trial, Policy Myth, Secret Session Hoax, Miracle Listicle respectively).
* Finish with a callout box encouraging readers to contact trusted organizations (ADA, CDC) when they encounter suspicious claims, exactly matching the language from the current implementation.

## CSS Requirements (`styles.css`)

* Define root-level custom properties for colors, border radius, shadows, font family, and max width.

    * Single-column about grid
    * Converts the misinformation table into a card-style layout using `data-label` attributes for headings.
